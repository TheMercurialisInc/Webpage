    <h3>Our History: A Legacy of Perseverance</h3>
    <p>
        From humble beginnings in the chaotic days of EVE's beta phase, Mercurialis Inc. has grown into an enduring powerhouse. Our journey has been punctuated by every major event in New Eden’s history, from the colossal battles of nullsec to the stealthy operations of wormhole space. We have weathered storms, built empires, and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with allies to defend the ideals we hold dear.
    </p>
    <h4>Highlights of Our Legacy:</h4>
