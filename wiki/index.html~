    <h3>Wiki Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
        By participating in any Mercurialis Inc. (MINC) operations, communications, or logistical activities, you acknowledge and accept the terms outlined below. Your continued existence in New Eden under the MINC banner constitutes implicit acceptance of these conditions, regardless of your origin, affiliation, or personal ambitions.
<br><br>MINC understands that capsuleers come from diverse backgrounds, whether bound by the faith of the Amarr, the discipline of the Caldari, the freedoms of the Gallente, or the resourcefulness of the Minmatar. However, it is important to note that divine intervention, corporate efficiency, artistic expression, or improvised engineering do not exempt pilots from the realities of loss and liability. The wreckage of your ship, regardless of its cultural significance, remains your responsibility. Overconfidence in doctrine deviations, unapproved modifications, or spontaneous acts of heroism are undertaken at your own risk, and MINC assumes no obligation to reimburse for assets lost due to such actions.
<br><br>By engaging in MINC operations, you waive any expectation of privacy. Communications, fleet movements, and strategic discussions are subject to logging, review, and potential blackmail for the greater good of the corporation. Private channels are monitored, and intelligence gathering is a core function of MINC operations. If you were hoping for confidentiality, you are in the wrong universe.
<br><br>By continuing to serve under Mercurialis Inc., you accept full accountability for your actions, losses, and triumphs. The universe is harsh, and only the prepared survive. Fly smart, fly safe, and remember—your ship, your responsibility.
