    <h3>In-Game Intel Channels</h3>
    <p>
        Communication is critical for effective intelligence gathering. Mercurialis Inc. relies on dedicated in-game channels to share real-time intel across our operations. Always stay connected and vigilant in these channels:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>MINC Intel:</strong> Our primary in-game channel for reporting enemy movements, suspicious activity, and ongoing engagements. Be concise and accurate when reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>Alliance Intel:</strong> When operating within our alliance, use their intel channels for broader coordination and situational awareness.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Use these channels responsibly. Avoid cluttering them with unrelated chatter, and always verify the accuracy of your reports before sharing.

    <h3>Vigilance Against Hostile "Blue Eyes"</h3>
    <p>
        In the shadowy world of New Eden, spies and hostile agents—known as "blue eyes"—are always lurking. Protecting our operations and intel requires constant vigilance. Here’s how you can help safeguard Mercurialis Inc.:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Verify Members:</strong> Always double-check the credentials of new fleet members. Use tools like RIFT and in-game corp logs to ensure their legitimacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Discreet:</strong> Avoid sharing sensitive information (e.g., fleet compositions, staging locations) in public or unsecured channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> If you notice unusual behavior or inconsistencies in member activity, report it to leadership immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Alert:</strong> Pay attention to enemy behavior in intel channels. Often, spies will attempt to feed false information to disrupt operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Trust is earned, not given. By remaining vigilant, we can minimize risks and maintain the integrity of our operations.

    <h3>Best Practices for Intel Gathering</h3>
    <p>
        To ensure our intel is accurate, actionable, and timely, follow these best practices:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be Concise:</strong> When reporting in intel channels, keep your messages short and clear. Include key details like ship types, fleet sizes, and system names.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Local Chat:</strong> Monitor local chat for spikes in player activity or suspicious individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Scout Effectively:</strong> When scouting, provide consistent updates and avoid engaging the enemy unless instructed by the fleet commander.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordinate with Allies:</strong> Share relevant intel with allied corporations and alliances to strengthen our collective security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Remember, timely and accurate intel can make the difference between victory and defeat. Stay sharp and always prioritize the safety of the fleet.
